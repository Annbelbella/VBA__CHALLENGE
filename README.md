# VBA__CHALLENGE

Hello, Please view my VBA Script that i have shared using notepad. Kindly note that i encountered issues with my conditional formatting as my computer automatically assigns an # symbol when i input 0.00 ( reflected as 0# on my script) and it has also failed to run as it should that's why some cells were not highlighted. I have also shared screenshots of the first and last page for each of the years indication the ticker symbol, yearly change, percent yearly change and total volume stock. Thankyou!

Kind regards, 
Annbell
